I am Senky, I like to do cool shit involving science and/or programming. I like to read. I read in genres such as money, psychology, knowledge about the world etc. I have been programming since I was 10, so I can a lot of stuff. Here, science implies physics and math. I like to research about physics and math. <br />Currently struggling in the Indian education system :)</p><ul><li>Books: I talk about the books I read.</li><li>Coding: I make devlogs and also tutorials/articles.</li><li>Science: I talk about cool shit I find in physics and math.</li><li>Ideas: I talk about random ideas in my mindspace.</li></ul><p>So here I take my leave for now, see you all later. Cheers! Goodbye.</p></div></body></html>
