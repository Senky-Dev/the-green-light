The Book 'Alchemist' by Paulo Coelho is not a book, more like an experience. It feels like you are actually there with the journeying protagonist. The plot, is about a vision experienced by a teenage shepherd, who is out to explore the world. The vision leads him on an exciting journey through new lands, also learning lessons about destiny and dreams along the way. 

The book approaches us with the idea that we can achieve our dreams and live them, at any time we wish to. We just need to take the first step, for if it is our true dream, even god will provide us with beginner's luck. The book also talks about understanding the language of the omens, for they are the true indicators of the will of god. The book also talks about something called the Language of the World & the Soul of The World. The Soul of the World is composed of everything that is living and existing in it. The Language of the World also includes the previously mentioned omens. It means to convey that if one communicates with the Soul of the World and understands the Language of the World, he is bound to achieve his dream.

Overall, this book is one which has left a mark on me, as the storytelling is immaculate and imprints its lessons onto you. I really appreciate the write Paulo Coelho. I have been reading some of his other works, and I can tell he is no ordinary writer. Alchemist does have a really dreamy setting but I feel some parts of it, if one believes in god, have pratical application to the world.

I actually recommend everyone to read this.
