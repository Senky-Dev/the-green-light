Okay, so you have stumbled upon my blog, therefore, I am obliged to tell you about myself. I am Senky, I like to do cool shit involving science and/or programming. I like to read. I read in genres such as money, psychology, knowledge about the world etc. I have been programming since I was 10, so I can a lot of stuff. Here, science implies physics and math. I like to research about physics and math. \
Currently struggling in the Indian education system :) 
* Books: I talk about the books I read.
* Coding: I make devlogs and also tutorials/articles.
* Science: I talk about cool shit I find in physics and math.
* Ideas: I talk about random ideas in my mindspace. 
  
So here I take my leave for now, see you all later. Cheers! Goodbye.
