This is most probably the first time you have stumbled upon my blog. Hello! I am Senky, A Programmer, who is a bit obsessed with science. I am an avid reader too, and as you may have noticed, I have a separate section for books.  
The main reason I made this blog was because of the innumerable thoughts which come to my conscience which I feel go to waste almost every day. Therefore, instead of wasting those thoughts, I felt it would be a great idea, to write them somewhere.  
So I am here to share my knowledge with all those who might be interested. I have not made this blog with the intention of growing, instead, with the intention of sharing my knowledge with all those who desire it.  
So I am going to proceed by describing the purpose of the four sections of this blog.
  
* Books: This section is for the analyses of all the books I read going forward.    
* Coding: In this section, I will share some of my programming hacks which I have learnt for experience. Further, I will also share project updates if I feel the need to do so.  
* Science: This section is going to be all about my obsession with physics and mathematics, I will post my thoughts on new discoveries + even some articles on interesting topics of science.  
* Ideas: This section is all about my philosophical ideas, and also about the absurd and useful ideas which come to my mind.  
  
So here I take my leave for now, see you all later. Cheers! Goodbye.
